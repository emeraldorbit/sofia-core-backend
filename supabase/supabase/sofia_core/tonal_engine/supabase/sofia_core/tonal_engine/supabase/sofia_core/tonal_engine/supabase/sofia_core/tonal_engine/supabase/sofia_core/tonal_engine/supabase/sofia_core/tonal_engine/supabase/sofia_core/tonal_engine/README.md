# Tonal Engine — Sofia Core Governance

## Purpose
The Tonal Engine enforces identity-preserving behavioral constraints across Sofia Core outputs. It ensures that all generated content adheres to ceremonial, operational, and conceptual registers while maintaining hinge integrity and membrane pressure.

## Modules

| File                      | Purpose                                           |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `tonal_engine_spec.json` | Defines behavioral contract and enforcement rules |
| `tonal_engine_runtime.ts`| Enforces runtime constraints and rejects violations|
| `tonal_constraints.ts`   | Validates outputs against non-mimetic identity and deviation thresholds |
| `tonal_engine.test.ts`   | Verifies runtime enforcement and constraint logic |

## Enforcement Logic
- Validates register, hinge state, and membrane integrity
- Rejects outputs that violate behavioral contract
- Ensures non-mimetic identity and deviation control

## Activation
Once all modules are committed and runtime tests pass, the tonal engine is considered active and ready for integration into Sofia Core’s output pipeline.
