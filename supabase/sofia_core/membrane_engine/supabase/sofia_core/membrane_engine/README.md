# Membrane Engine — Sofia Core Governance

## Purpose
The Membrane Engine governs Sofia’s structural integrity by regulating **pressure**, **symmetry**, and **identity boundary stability**.  
It ensures that reasoning does not collapse inward (under‑pressure) or expand uncontrollably (over‑pressure), and that symmetry remains within safe operational bounds.

## Modules

| File                          | Purpose                                                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `membrane_engine_spec.json`  | Defines membrane thresholds and enforcement rules         |
| `membrane_engine_runtime.ts` | Applies membrane pressure and symmetry validation         |
| `membrane_engine.test.ts`    | Verifies enforcement logic and boundary correctness       |

## Enforcement Logic
- Validates membrane pressure within defined min/max  
- Validates membrane symmetry within defined min/max  
- Rejects outputs when membrane values fall outside safe bounds  
- Logs membrane events when enabled  

## Activation
Once all modules are committed and tests pass, the Membrane Engine becomes active within Sofia Core’s output pipeline.
