# Sofia Core Manifest — System-Level Declaration

## Purpose
The Sofia Core Manifest defines the entire Sofia Core backend as a unified system.  
It declares subsystem status, governance mode, version metadata, and global integrity rules.

## Contents
- `sofia_core_manifest.json` — the authoritative system declaration  
- Subsystem activation map  
- Governance configuration  
- Version and maintainer metadata  

## Role in the Architecture
The manifest sits above all engines, the pipeline, the API, and the index.  
It is the single source of truth for:

- system identity  
- subsystem activation  
- governance strictness  
- compatibility and versioning  

## Maintainer
Emerald Estates® — Sofia Core Governance
